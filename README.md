# google_login
Tired of not working Google Authorisation for your requests?
This module is what you need!
Helps you to login into Google Analytics or Google Spreadsheets
Also needed modules:
1. Google API. To install: pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client
2. json
3. httplib2
4. oauth2client - any version (hopefully) will do, so you san keep using your favorite version without upgrading

To work with Google Spreadsheets I recommend gspread (https://github.com/burnash/gspread)
